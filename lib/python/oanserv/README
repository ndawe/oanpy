This Python package contains code that is used to implement a
client-side server that accepts connections and subscriptions to
specific instrument updates. This allows one to internally feed market
data to several disconnected programs with a single connection to
OANDA.

IMPORTANT: You are responsible for insuring your own compliance with
the OANDA terms for market data redistribution; therefore, you should
not open such a service on a public port. The intention of this
program is for you to decouple your own programs (internally) from the
OANDA API connections, for market data updates.
