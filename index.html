<h1 class="title">OanPy: Python Bindings for OANDA Trading API</h1>

<p>This open source package provides an extension module for <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> that
can be used to access to the programmatic API for the <a class="reference external" href="http://fxtrade.oanda.com">OANDA</a> FX
broker. The entire API's functionality is supported, including live
market data updates and order placement.</p>
<p>The ability to do fast prototyping of trading strategies directly
using a dynamic language like <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> is very exciting. You can
leverage numerical libraries like NumPy in order to perform analysis
on market data directly from the API, or you can write custom trading
GUIs leveraging toolkits, e.g., PyQt. Our API works in multi-threaded
environments, and is compatible with select()/epoll() reactor-based
networking libraries (and with <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a>).</p>
<div class="section" id="how-it-works">
<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>In order to use these <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> bindings, you will need to
<strong>independently obtain a license</strong> to the Linux C++ API from <a class="reference external" href="http://fxtrade.oanda.com">OANDA</a>,
and then run a Makefile to build and install your <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> extension
module, linked with this API.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="doc/howitworks.png" src="doc/howitworks.png" />
</div>
<p>Once again, this package does <strong>NOT</strong> provide the include files nor
the binary library that OANDA makes available to its subscribers. You
need to obtain this separately (i.e., it costs money).</p>
<p>With it, you will be able to import all of the functionality provided
by the OANDA API with a simple import, for example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Import the OANDA classes.
from oanda import *

...

# Login to my OANDA account.
fxclient = FXTrade()
try:
    fxclient.login(username, password)
except OAException, e:
    raise SystemExit(&quot;Could not login: %s&quot; % e)

# Get my account object.
user = fxclient.getUser()
account = user.getAccounts()[0]

...

# Place a trade.
order = MarketOrder()
order.base, order.quote = 'EUR', 'USD'
order.units = 10000
trades = account.execute(order)
for trade in trades:
    print trade

...
</pre>
<p>The classes and functions names correspond directly to the
documentation that <a class="reference external" href="http://fxtrade.oanda.com">OANDA</a> will provide for your API library.
This package's documentation only describes difference between the
official API and our mapping into Python.</p>

<h1>Caveats</h1>
<p>Some information about the data feed (as of 2009):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The OANDA API can be used to write trading automatons, but is not a
&#8220;high-frequency&#8221; trading API by today's standards:  trade
confirmations take one to several seconds--contrast this with
connections to today's main exchanges where you can achieve a
turnaround time in the order of a few hundreds of microseconds. Note
that this is perfectly fine if your holding periods are on the order
of a few minutes, or even a few tens of seconds, or if you're using
this to automate some sort of currency hedging.</li>
<li>You cannot buy at the bid nor sell at the offer, i.e., OANDA forces
you to cross the spread in order to execute all orders, in
particular, limit orders. Their &quot;limit orders&quot; are slightly
different: they simply sit on their books until the spread happens
to cross to your order. This is a market maker, remember, you're not
trading directly with others, you're trading with OANDA's level 1
book.</li>
<li>The market data feed sometimes sends market data out-of-order: about
0.5% of all updates have timestamps that are either incorrect or not
flushed in sequence. The server we provide has an option to filter
those out.</li>
<li>The C++ API's network layer flushes its orders in blocks, and they
are not transmitted as soon as they are available on the remote
side. You might want to use the Java API if you want faster
updates... but given the delays involved in &quot;normal&quot; operation, I
doubt it's worth the effort.</li>
<li>OANDA indicated via its forums that its Java API is more stable than
its C++ API. This is most likely because their developers are more
comfortable with Java--whatever that may mean to you. Note: the Java
API is fairly clean and it is not unreasonable to consider writing
your code directly that API instead (if you speak Java).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Supported Platforms: Linux</h1>
<p>Currently, we support only the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> platform (both Ubuntu 9.04 and
Gentoo are known to work).</p>
<p>If you are interested in support for Windows or Mac and are willing to
pay for it by the hour, please contact <a class="reference external" href="/home/contact.html">the author</a>.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The GNU LGPL allows you to write private/secret programs against the
library. Using this open source library does <em>NOT</em> imply that you
need to share your code with others. You can use the library to
write top-secret trading strategies to take over the world if you
like :-)</li>
<li>The license has a liability clause in it; thus Furius is not
responsible for any loss which you may incur as a result of using
this code. It is <em>entirely</em> your own responsibility to insure that
the code you're using works as you'd expect.</li>
<li>There are no guarantees that this API will get updated if the OANDA
API changes. You may have to do this yourself if you come to depend
on it. (However, it would probably be easy to do so, given you have
all the source code).</li>
