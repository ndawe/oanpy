Introduction
============

OANDA is an FX market maker which provides interesting innovations in
the market, in particular,

- No overnight rollovers;
- Interest differentials paid by the second (accrued and paid at
  16h30);
- The ability to buy/sell any quantity, as low as one unit of any
  currency.

This allows small players to access to the FX market without all the
fuss that is generally required for FX trading. It also allows the
trading of small sizes, and for the precise hedging of other
positions.

OANDA provides the ability to automate trading activities via a
programmable interface (the OANDA API) and provides live market data
via this interface. This is the subject of this software: it is sugar
coating that allows you to access this API via a the powerful, dynamic
features of the Python computer language. OANDA provides the API in a
few other computer languages: a Java library which works across
multiple platforms, and a C++ library, supported under Linux, Windows
and Mac OS X.

About the Implementation
------------------------

The Python bindings are built on top of the C++ libraries, and should
be as stable or unstable as this library. All of the API is supported,
with only minor differences due to the language translation. In
addition, some extra functionality is provided in a Python pacakge
which is built built on top of the API we provide.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

At the time of writing, the Python bindings are complete and supported
only on the Linux platform.

details.


Build and Installation
======================

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to install:

- Python 2.x, along with its static library and include files;

- Boost: we only link against the Boost.Python and Boost.Thread
  libraries;

- The GCC compiler (version 4 or greater should do);

- Scons, in order to build the source code into a module.

If you will use the `oanserv` server, in addition you will need:

- Twisted (e.g. 2.5 or more recent)
- Version 2.6 of Python, or greater (because of the
  `collections.nametuple` class which we use).


Environment Notes and Setup
---------------------------

The code we provide does **not** include the client from OANDA's API
(libfxclient.a and header files). You need to purchase your own
license and obtain this library from them, as the API agreement
clearly states that we cannot provide it to any thirdparty.

Set the `OANDA_API` environment variable to indicate the build
programs where you have unpacked the header files and C++ library,
e.g.::

   OANDA_API = $(HOME)/fxclient/
   export OANDA_API


Build Instructions
------------------
::

  cd src/
  scons      # build
  scons -c   # clean up

The output should look something like this::

  scons: done cleaning targets.

  Install file: "_oanda.so" as "/home/blais/p/oanpy/lib/python/oanda/_oanda.so"
  scons: done building targets.

The target DSO should sit in `lib/python/oanda/_oanda.so`. This should
be a working Python extension module (though it is not meant to be
imported directly, the oanda package takes care of that, and adds code
written in pure Python as well), see `oanda/__init__.py`.


Installation
------------

Run the usual distutil procedure to have the files installed in your
Python distribution::

   python setup.py install

To test the installation, try to import the module; if no error
occurs, it worked::

  tangerine:~$ python
  Python 2.6.2 (release26-maint, Apr 19 2009, 01:56:41)
  [GCC 4.3.3] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import oanda
  >>>

(Note: the `oanda` package imports the `_oanda.so` DSO itself.)



Brief Usage Documentation
=========================

Account Information
-------------------
You create a connection by instantiating a “client”: either an
`FXGame` or an `FXTrade` object. Note that **before** you call the
`login()` method, you may have to set some of the general connection
parameters::

    fxclient = FXTrade()
    try:
        fxclient.login(username, password)
    except OAException, e:
        raise SystemExit("Could not login: %s" % e)

    [...]

    fxclient.logout()


Fetching Exchange Rates (Polling)
---------------------------------
Get a single rate via the global object `RateTable`::

  tick = fxclient.getRateTable().getRate(Pair('USD/CAD'))


Subscribing to Rate Updates
---------------------------
The OANDA API requires you to derive from the `RateEvent` class in order to subcribe
and handle market data events. This works the same way with Python, create a new
class and override its `handle()` method::

  from oanda import RateEvent

  class RatesMonitor(oanda.RateEvent):

      def match(self, event_info):
          # Return false if you don't want to handle this (default is True).

      def handle(self, event_info, event_manager):
          # Handle the market data update.

  [...]

  # Enable the rate thread (important).
  fxclient.setWithRateThread(True)

  mon = RatesMonitor()
  fxclient.getRateTable().eventManager().add(mon)


Order Placement
---------------
To place orders, create the class corresponding to the type of order
you'd like to place, and execute it on the account. You will get a
list of “trade” objects back, that correspond to your orders (the name
is poorly chosen, but that's from the API so I prefer not to change
it)::

    order = MarketOrder()
    order.base, order.quote = pair.split('/')
    order.units = 1
    modtrades = acc.execute(order)
    for trade in modtrades:
        print
        print '  ', str(trade)


Trade Confirmations
-------------------

Monitor trade confirmations works similarly as for rate updates,
they're called “Account events”::

  from oanda import AccountEvent

  class AccountEventsMonitor(oanda.AccountEvent):

      def handle(self, event_info, event_manager):
          # Handle the account event.

  [...]

  # Enable the rate thread (important).
  fxclient.setWithRateThread(True)

  user = fxclient.getUser()
  for acc in user.getAccounts():
      mon = AccountEventsMonitor(acc)
      acc.eventManager().add(mon)


Fetching Historical Data
------------------------
See the `RateTable.getHistory()` methods. Instead of taking a vector
as input, they are modified to return Python `list` objects with the
results.



API Differences
===============

Mapping of Names
----------------

Because the Python API is a direct mapping on top of the C++ API, we
do not provide documentation specific to it other than this document.
The main reference should be the include files that you should have
obtained once you acquired the license from OANDA itself. This file
only documents the differences between the C++ version of the OANDA
API and the Python view that we provide..

Naming of Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The names of the Python classes are the same as those of the C++ API,
except for one thing: for consistency, we have removed the “FX” prefix
from the class names that had them in the C++ API, except for the
FXClient, FXGame and FXTrade object (the OANDA interface is
inconsistent in this way, some of its classes are prefixed and some
are not).

This includes the following renamings::

  FXAccountEvent            ->    AccountEvent
  FXAccountEventInfo        ->    AccountEventInfo
  FXEvent                   ->    Event
  FXEventInfo               ->    EventInfo
  FXEventManager            ->    EventManager
  FXHistoryPoint            ->    HistoryPoint
  FXInstrument              ->    Instrument
  FXPair                    ->    Pair
  FXRateEvent               ->    RateEvent
  FXRateEventInfo           ->    RateEventInfo
  FXTick                    ->    Tick
  FXTransactionType         ->    TransactionType

(Note: if you insist on using the original names, you can do that too,
because we also provide aliases for all the original class names as
well, e.g. `FXTick` and `Tick` reference the very same class object.)

Naming of Methods vs. Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The methods on C++ classes are exposed on Python classes as either
methods or “properties”, which look like attributes.

*Methods*

  If the name of the C++ method is a verb/action, it is exposed as a
  method on the Python class, e.g.::

    tick = rate_table.getRate('EUR/USD')
    ...
    itick = tick.getInverse()    # Call a method on the Tick class.

*Properties*

  However, if a function was meant to provide read-only data, or two
  accessors were provided to read and write a data attribute, we are
  providing the functions via Python properties. This means that you
  can read and write the attribute using the usual attribute syntax,
  e.g.::

    print tick.bid    # Reading the 'bid' attribute
    tick.bid += 0.01  # Writing the 'bid' attribute

Naming of Enumerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C++ “enum“ types are provided as special objects with the same name as
their C++ type, with attributes for their specific values, e.g.::

  rate_table.getHistory(Pair('EUR/USD'),
                        INTERVAL.INTERVAL_10_SEC,   # <-- (enum)
                        60)


Holding References to Objects
-----------------------------

During the development of the bindings, I have occasionally exposed
some of the transient objects provided by the callbacks, to the Python
side. Keeping and using a reference to those objects from Python would
cause a core dump (the C++ objects get freed within the OANDA C++
library).

The solution is rather inelegant: create a copy of the objects
whenever a callback is invoked. This is what is being done at the
moment but it really is the lesser of two evils. In any case, you
should try to avoid keeping around objects provided to you by callback
methods (or make copies of them instead).

Note: if someone feels like working out a scheme with the Python
interpreter's `weakptr` type, this could be a clean solution for this
problem (interesting little project).


Threads and Dispatching
-----------------------

The C++ client library uses a background thread to dispatch the rate
and account event callbacks. Because of limitations around the global
Python interperter lock, we need to queue the events and let you
choose the preferred method for dispatching them in the main Python
thread or otherwise. This requires you to choose a preferred
technique.

There are four methods for dispatch the events:

1. Blocking Call: You call the `fxevents_process_loop()` function,
   which will block and dispatch the events as they come. This becomes
   your main loop.

2. Polling: this is a variant on the previous method, where you are
   simply call a non-blocking version of the dispatcher at regular
   intervals (`fxevents_process_pending()`).

3. In another Python thread: you create a separate thread in Python to
   handle the blocking call in (1).

4. Using `select()`: you block on a call to `select()`, juggling the
   I/O of data on sockets and the dispatching of queued events. The
   module allows you to set a file descriptor that it writes a single
   byte to when a new event has arrived. This wakes up the `select()`
   call and you can dispatch the events immediately.

There are examples for each of these methods in
`lib/python/oanda/dispatch.py`. The example code for the
`select()`-based dispatch uses xTwisted.


Integration with a GUI toolkit
------------------------------

I have not yet completed integration with a GUI toolkit. I've been
meaning to write a GUI application using PyQt. I think it would work
like this:

- Your execution loop in the main UI/Python thread would be the GUI's
  loop, without modification.

- You would dispatch messages via a separate Python-level thread,
  which would either

  a) Wake up the GUI loop/thread using a “custom GUI event”, and you
     would have this event trigger a callback in the main thread to
     dispatch the events using `fxevents_process_pending()`.

  b) Dispatch the messages directly from the other Python thread,
     which is possible because of the GIL restriction (no other Python
     code will be able to run in the same PVM during this time). You
     would need to be careful with thread-local data and non-Python
     locking issues.



Enabling the Background Threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't seem to get rate or historical data, make sure you have
enabled the rate-thread before logging in (see chat log below).


About Timestamps
----------------

Be careful when initializing objects with timestamps, the expected
time resolution is in seconds, and if you use Python's time.time()
function, it returns a float. You will need to convert that to an int
to use the API functions.


Precision of Types for Prices
-----------------------------

The OANDA API provides prices as C type `double`, which is unwise, due
to rounding error. See the module `lib/python/oanda/prices.py` which
provides functions to convert to `Decimal` or `int` Python objects.


Server
======

The code includes `oanserv`, a program that will connect to the API
and serve market data on a port. Look at the code for details. There
is also a watchdog process that will insure that this server is always
up (the OANDA C++ API crashes every now and then, for some reason).

A description of the simple protocol uses to connect to this server
can be `found here`__.
