About the Background Threads
============================

  > Q: ***IMPORTANT** The rate updates I get seem like they're
  >    buffered, i.e., they come as a batch every second or so,
  >    instead of being immediately sent. However, the GUI updates
  >    more often that, it does not seem like it's batched at all.
  >    I'm guessing that maybe this batching feature is not present

  The rates update are still dragging mode for C++ version. Since the
  new streaming rates feature has only been released for FXServer for
  2 month, we are still working on the C++ version to support the new
  feature. The Java one has a beta release already. The C++ version
  can only work like this for now.


  > Q: In FXClient, what is a keep-alive-thread? Why do I need one?

  FXClient.setWithKeepAliveThread is only used for without
  RateThread. If you are using RateThread, it will keep syncing with
  server side, else you need to turn KeepAliveThreadon. This will
  keep your session alive, so server side will not cleanyour session
  from the session pool because you have no action for morethan 10
  minutes.


  > Q: In FXClient, what is a rate-thread? Why and when do I need one?

  Same as previous.


About Latency
=============

  > Q: Why don't you provide the default timeout as an attribute of the
  >    FXClient object? Right now I can set it, but I cannot get it, I
  >    cannot find what it is.

  The timeout is used to evaluate your rates delay, if the lag is big,
  then treat as timeout and throw exception.

  Current rates update for C++ version is 2-3 seconds. The are stored
  inside the rateTable.

  > If I have a rate thread and I subscribe to only a few instruments, does it only

  To your last question, it will not help. Now the server will send you
  all the pairs data, even you subscribe less will not save your
  bandwidth.


About Various API Strangeness
=============================

  > Q: In FXClient, what is the purpose of those loadable key files? Why
  >    do they speed the connection and why would I ever not use them if
  >    they make something faster? Do they waste resources? What's the
  >    story?

  Loadable key files just save the time to regenerate connection key on
  both server side and client side.


  > Q: On class User, there is a method to get and set the 'profile' (a
  >    string) of the User. This value is empty in my test account, and
  >    setting it to a value does nothing (i.e. getting the value
  >    afterwards still returns an empty string).  What is this 'profile'
  >    used for and why does setting it not work?

  The profile instance value will be initialized after you login.


  > Q: In FXRateEventInfo and FXAccountEventInfo, what does compare_less
  >    do exactly? For FXRateEventInfo, I'm assuming that it copmares the
  >    timestamps of the tick, but for FXAccountEventInfo, what is done?
  >    This is not documented.

  (Question unanswered.)


  > What is the logging object?

  I am sorry, for the log problem, since this lib is really new. We are
  still fighting with it. The old one used to work well, but for this
  new one, we are still working on it. My personal opinion, the Java
  version is better than C++ version.



About Timestamps
================

  > Q: In Order.h: the duration parameter's description is woefully
  >    inadequate, it doesn't say if it is a time relative to epoch, or a
  >    number of seconds, and by fiddling with it it isn't obvious to find
  >    valid values::
  >
  > 	* Duration is measured in seconds as a unix timestamp (time_t).
  > 	* The range of valid duration times is:
  > 	*  greater than current time and less than 30 days or 2592000 seconds.

  It is seconds.

  --

  We do compare the timestamps when requesting ticks, if the timestamp
  is not fresh, we will discard it.


About Instruments
=================

  > Q: How do I enumerate the list of all valid instruments supported
  >    by the system? It seems the only way to get an FXInstrument is
  >    by calling findInstrument(), which requires you to provide the
  >    pair string which you're looking for.

  Please try to not use the FXInstrument.

  For the instrument class, it is used internally. It has a long history
  and I am not sure why it is not public any more.

About Life Scope and Ownership of API Objects
=============================================

  > Q: About FXClient::getUser(), what is the lifetime of the returned
  >    User object? Am I supposed to delete it? If not, who does it? The
  >    sample programs don't seem to finalize anything. Similarly, the
  >    return value of FXClient::getRateTable(), who manages its lifetime?
  >    Am I supposed to delete it myself?
  >
  >    (Similar question for ALL the functions which return pointers...
  >    ownership is undocumented).

  The life time is together with the FXClient instance. You do not need
  to delete it.


About Historical Data
=====================

   > Q: The documentation for RateTable says that there is a maximum of
   >    either 365 or 500 records for the history points (and other similar
   >    data, Candles and MinMaxPoints), depending on the requested
   >    intervals. However, when you call them with a large value for
   >    'numTicks', you get either 366 or 501 records. Is this a bug?

   For the extra one, the last candle is not finished, it is the current
   candle.


About BoxOptions
================

> Q: Are Boxes simply not supported by the API? I could not find
>    anything about them in the include files.
>

Boxoption is not supported in API.

About Java vs. C++ APIs
=======================

  > Is there any way I could testdrive the Java API without disabling my C++
  > API access?

  We can send you the Java version for your testing. Just we only do the
  support work for one version at the same time.
